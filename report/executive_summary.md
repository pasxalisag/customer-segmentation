# Executive Summary – Customer Segmentation

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to segment pharmacy customers based on their purchasing behavior, in order to support sales prioritization, account management, and revenue growth decisions.

---

## Data Overview
The analysis is based on customer-level B2B pharmaceutical sales data, summarizing revenue, purchasing frequency, order value, and relationship duration for each pharmacy account.

This aggregated view reflects the type of data typically available to commercial and sales teams for strategic decision-making.

---

## Segmentation Approach
Customers were segmented using business-relevant metrics:
- Total revenue contribution
- Purchase frequency
- Average order value
- Length of the commercial relationship

The focus was on creating interpretable and actionable customer groups rather than purely technical clusters.

---

## Key Segments Identified
Four primary customer segments were defined:

- **Strategic Accounts**: High-value, high-frequency customers that drive a significant share of revenue.
- **Growth Accounts**: Customers with moderate current value but strong potential for expansion.
- **Stable Accounts**: Consistent customers with predictable purchasing behavior.
- **At-Risk Accounts**: Low-activity customers with declining or limited engagement.

---

## Business Implications
- Revenue is concentrated among a small number of strategic accounts, highlighting the importance of targeted relationship management.
- Growth accounts represent the highest upside potential if properly developed.
- At-risk accounts require timely intervention to prevent churn or disengagement.

---

## Recommendations
- Prioritize strategic accounts with tailored commercial strategies and proactive engagement.
- Invest in growth accounts through targeted promotions and portfolio expansion.
- Maintain stable accounts with efficient, low-intensity engagement.
- Design reactivation initiatives for at-risk accounts based on identified behavioral patterns.

## Strategic Value
This segmentation framework enables sales teams to allocate resources more effectively, improve customer lifetime value, and support data-driven commercial planning.
